# Calculator

## Description

This is a calculator web app that I created to practice javascript. It is meant to emulate the apple iPhone calculator app.

## Constraints

***All functionalities work except:***

***- When +/- or % is used on any operand except for the very first one***

***- Continuously pressing the equals after an operation is completed will result in nothing happening***
