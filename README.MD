# Calculator
This is a calculator web app that I created to practice javascript. It is meant to emulate the apple calculator app.

***All functionalities work except:***

***- When +/- or % is used on any operand except for the very first one***
***- Continuously pressing the equals after an operation is completed will result in nothing happening***
